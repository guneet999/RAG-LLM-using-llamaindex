This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [ 18] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,16]. In all but a few cases [ 22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [ 15] and ConvS2S [ 8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1,...,y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers.

We employ a residual connection [ 10] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer(x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack.

The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3].

For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 8] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1,...,x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,z n), withxi,zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [ 25] representations.

Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2).

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 17] withβ1= 0.9,β2= 0.98andϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate =d−0.5\\nmodel·min(step_num−0.5,step _num·warmup _steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup _steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [ 27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized.

The conﬁguration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5days on 8P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop= 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4and length penalty α= 0.6[31]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [31].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature.

Real -time object detection refers to the ability to \\ndetect and localize objects in a continuous stream of data. \\nThe background of real -time object detection stems from the \\nincreasing need for efficient and accurate analysis of visual \\ndata in real -world scenarios. Detection of objects is a crucial \\nwork in many well -known fields and holds immense \\nimportance in various domains including navigation of robots, augmented reality, automation, and medical \\ndiagnosis [1]. Similarly, object detection plays the same role \\nin detecting and differentiating images by neural networks. In such combination and unpredictable situations, all these detection methods will be built upon a deep learning perspective, those regions are constructed on neural networks (CNN), convolutional Networks as (SPP net), \\nfaster R -CNN, Regional based Fully Convolution Networks \\n(R-FCN), fast R- CNN, YOLO algorithm and Feature \\nPyramid Networks (FPN) show better advantages than traditional methods. Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN), \\nNetworks (R -FCN) and YOLO show more convenience a nd \\nimportance than already existing working methods [2]. You \\nonly look once algorithm is the best secured and quick \\nobject detection method with high accuracy and best training performance, also been improving since it was introduced, by involving all its yolo variations.  \\n1.1 Unified Detection  \\nThe total concept of unified detection in YOLO is based upon dividing the given input source into a grid, and every \\ngrid cell estimates some certain bounding boxes in fixed \\nnumbers along with respective class probabilities. These bounding boxes are responsible for detecting objects that fall within the grid cell. For processing an entire image Yolo uses a neural network and makes predictions for all objects simultaneously. Human beings interface the indifferent \\nelements of object detection mixing into one network. To \\npredict each bounding box, the Yolo network takes every feature from that complete image [3].

Lavanya and S. D. Pande  \\n  2      YOLO's unified detection approach include Grid Division, \\nAnchor Boxes, Prediction Generation and Non- Maximum \\nSuppression (NMS – eliminates redundant bounding boxes). \\nFirst, the machine divides the given image which contains the object into S x S grid. The confidence score tells how confident the training model will be confident the box containing the object, with how much accuracy it thinks the box has and the prediction capacity of the box how accurate \\nit is to predict [4]. Figure 1 represents grid division and the \\ncell parameters. And Figure 2 represents image and object classifications of a single object image.  \\n \\n(a) How it works when there are multiple objects.  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.  4x4 by 7 volumes (four by four total grid of \\n16 cells and every cell of vector of size 7)  \\n \\n(b) Work progress when there is a single object.  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 2.  Image of single object and its classification  \\n \\n(c) Brief about 3 main versions and improvements \\nof all versions:   \\n YOLO is a single -stage object detection model [5]. A \\nsimple neural network predicts class and bounding box \\nprobabilities directly from the images in just one set of \\nevaluations. If once the image is detected by the machine, \\nthe Yolo algorithm will start image processing after that it \\ndetects objects from the image using respective libraries. It faces errors and difficulties which appear as groups in \\ndetecting small objects. Object detection algorithms should \\nnot only be accurate in the prediction of object class but also with the location and must be incredibly fast while \\ndoing the process of the video processing in real -time \\ndemands. YOLO -V2 takes out all the connected layers \\nwhich are only fully or linear structured and for the \\nprediction of bounding boxes it introduced anchor boxes features like multi- scale training and included higher \\nresolution capacity. In general, already the object detection models having tiny objects were facing the problems of poor performance and low precision. Instead of predicting \\nthe coordinates of the bounding box directly from that \\nconvolution network, it uses linear connected layers to \\npredict bounding boxes [6]. From figure 3, it solves issues \\nlike low performance and precision, a model based upon a deep learning approach which was yolo- v2 having tiny \\nobjects, called O -YOLO- v2 (Optimized yolo v2) [7].  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 3.  Yolo – v2 design.  \\n \\nTo increase the improvement of object detection it targets various measurements mainly focused on smaller objects, \\nand a different multi- sectoral detection algorithm is \\nintroduced involving the latest YOLO -V3 [8]. Yolo- V3 \\nboosts excellent performance in a wide range of input or \\ngiven resolutions YOLOv3 further improved upon its predecessors by introducing a few key enhancements. It \\nutilized a variant of the dark net architecture called Darknet -\\n53, which improved feature extraction capabilities. Yolo- V3 \\nscored 37 mAP in the Test with a given input resolution of \\n608x608 on the COCO -2017 validation set [9]. The new \\nupgradation of this algorithm with a comparatively smaller archetype size of artificial environments is tiny yolo v3.

For achieving maximum object detection output as compared to some other approaches, the deep neural networks (DNNs) were revealed, as all know YOLO version2 is an existing state in DNN -dependent \\nobject detection techniques in both terms of accuracy and processing speed. Even though yolov2 can achieve real -time \\nhigh performance on a powerful graphics processing unit, it remains very objectifying for holding this method for actual time detection of objects in video on devices like embedded \\nsystems with only related computer memory or power. Here \\nthere is a proposal of a new framework which is Fast YOLO, called framework as fast You Only Look Once which advances yolo version2 to perform detection of objects in running video in a real -time manner on devices \\nthat are embedded [12]. This type of a single convolution \\nnetwork simultaneously forecasts numerous bounding boxes \\nand the probability of classes for the boxes [13]. Wi th zero \\nprocessing of batch on a GPU TitanX this base network will run at 45 fps and the faster version will run at more than 150 frames per second and by this we can process the detection of any streamed videotape in real -time with minimal 25ms \\nof latency [14].  YOLO is globally the best when comes to the image and its process of prediction. Contrastive to the sliding window method and regional -based proposal \\nmethods YOLO can observe the entire image in the process of test time and training. So that it com pletely encodes the \\nprovisional info about its appearance and classes. YOLO has \\nthe learning capability to recognize the generalized portrayal \\nof objects. As soon as YOLO is trained on general images and tested in real -time work, YOLO outruns best object \\ndetection methods like DPM and regions with CNN by an extensive edge [15]. From figure 5, it visualizes the \\ndetection of different objects. yolo- SA is an improved \\nversion of the one -stage detection model YOLO v4 [16]. \\nTable 1 represents comparative analysis  of all yolo versions \\nin the division of Years, improvements, and total no. of \\nlayers in the network.\\n \\n  \\n \\nFigure 5.

Lavanya and S. D. Pande  \\n  4      has 24 convolution layers which is connected by 2 fully \\nconnected layers. As a substitute of the established units \\nworn by Google net, it generally uses 1 × 1 reductant layers \\ncoming after 3 × 3 convolution layers. With 9 convolution layers instead of 24 layers and some filters in those layers will be used by neural networks of Fast YOLO. By not considering the dimensions of the network, coaching and trailing parameters are so equal between YOLO and Fast \\nYOLO [17]. Fig6 presents the Network architecture of the \\nYolo algorithm as this model advances for sum squared misconception or error in the desired output. The main advantage of the sum squared error is its ease to optimization even though this doesn’t have perfect alignment with the moto of increasing mean accuracy. This \\nloads classified error the same as the localized error which \\nwouldn’t be absolute. We can also observe in every image, that not all grid cells contain objects that may be empty. So that those empty grids’ confidence scores will be pushed towards zero. Therefore, it affects model instability [18]. Coming for analysis of error in this algorithm in comparison \\nto fast regional CNN proves that localization errors in \\nYOLO have a large signification count.  For the regularization model, we use batch or group normalization. For removing dropouts from representation without overfitting fo r this we use Batch Normalization. \\nConvolutional layers with pre -well- defined bounding boxes \\nwith custom widths and heights which are called Anchor boxes. For the prediction of the bounding box coordinates Yolo uses a feature extractor that is fully connected layers which are high in the convolutional layers. But we get some decrease in its accuracy due to the use of anchor boxes. \\nGenerally, YOLO can predict 98 boxes for any single image \\nbut by using predefined bounding boxes (anchor boxes) it can predict m ore than thousands of boxes. If Yolo doesn’t \\nuse anchor boxes, then the basic model assures to get 69.5 mAP with 81% of recall [19]. In addition to anchor boxes, the model assures to get 69.2 mAP with 88% of recall [20]. \\nIt implies there is a decrease in MAP and increases in recall \\npercentage so there is a chance to improve the performance of the model. After it increases the loss of predictions from bounding box coordinates then considers boxes that don’t contain objects and decreases the dropping from Confidence \\npredictions. In this way we mainly focus on the \\nimprovement of localization and recall percentage and to maintain classification accuracy it adds the Batch Normalization method on every convolution layer present in YOLO then we can increase 2% improvement in mAP. Below figure 6, visualizes the network architecture of the \\nYolo algorithm.  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n  Figure 6.  Network architecture of yolo algorithm [21]  \\n4. Literature Survey  \\nFor the detection of objects, YOLO requires a neural network which is only one side front propagation. Between two frame images for the frame differencing, it uses pixel -\\nwise differentiation which is background representation for the detection of objects and background subtraction for \\ndetecting moving regions by a Gaussian mixture model [22]. \\nThe proposal of a backward history model for identifying the object is raised by Stauffer and Grimson [23]. Background subtraction for the detection of moving objects is proposed by Liu et al that is in any image is done by \\nrecording the pixel -by-pixel difference between reference \\nand present background pictures [24]. Sungandi et al. have \\nintroduced the detection of objects in low -resolution images \\nby using frame differences [25]. The proposal of a new shadow detection in video clippings and untouched background model is done by Jacques et al [26]. Instead of \\nthe classification method, yolo got a name like detection of \\nobjects as a regression problem by the authors of YO LO \\n[27] which implies that YOLO performed with more accuracy and much faster. E ven it can also predict artwork \\nperfectly. Figure 7 represents the flow chart of the process. Ghosh et al. (2023) embarked on a comprehensive \\nstudy to assess water quality through predictive machine learning. Their research underscored the potential of machine learning models in effectively assessing and classifying water quality. The dataset used for this purpose included parameters like pH, dissolved oxygen, BOD, and \\nTDS. Among the various models they employed, the \\nRandom Forest model emerged as the most a ccurate, \\nachieving a commendable accuracy rate of 78.96%. In contrast, the SVM model lagged behind, registering the lowest accuracy of 68.29% [33].Alenezi et al.

The method addresses color \\nchannel attenuation and optimizes local and global pixel values. By employing a unique Markov random field, the approach refines image edges. Performance evaluations, using metrics like  UCIQE and UIQM, demonstrated the \\nsuperiority of this method over existing techniques, resulting in sharper, clearer, and more colorful underwater images.[34].  \\nEAI Endorsed Transactions on \\nInternet of Things \\n| Volume 10 | 2024 |', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Flow chart of object detection model  \\n5. Yolo object detection algorithm is \\ncrucial because of the given reasons:  \\n \\nSpeed:  As YOLO predict objects in real -time, it improves \\ndetection speed. Compared to other algorithms yolo can \\nperform much faster running at 45 frames per second. Another main difference is YOLO has the capability to see complete images at only once which is not present in previous methods [28]. We will run the image on CNN for only one time at run time. All the testing and training \\nparameters are as same as between fast Yolo and YOLO \\n[29].  \\n \\nHigh accuracy:  YOLO has a high prediction capacity that \\ngives the best results with fewer background mistakes. There are some different heuristics to increase yolo \\naccuracies like cosine learning rate scheduler, data \\naugmentation, batch normalization (synchronized) and image mix -up [30]. Having a larger pixel quality improves \\naccuracy but takes off with inference and slow training time. For more accuracy large pixel quality may help the model to detect small objects.  \\n \\nLearning capabilities:  yolo has a high learning capability, \\nwhich allows one to find out the patterns of the objects and \\napply them in the process of detection of objects. Yolo acquired the object detection by division of an image into N \\ngrids, of equal dimensions S x S.  Based on the COCO \\ndataset (common objects in context), this algorithm can detect classes of 80 COCO objects: bus, person, car, Bicycle, motorbike, aeroplane, truck, train, boat [31].  \\n  \\nHigh -resolution classifier : Generally, before training, a \\nreal YOLO neural network uses 224×224 pixels and then changes to 448×448 P while recognition. In the process of changing from one model to another model which is classification to detection model, the model adjusts to the classification of the image. YOLO version 2 segments the prior training method into just two steps: train the network \\nwith 224×224 Pixels and convert the pixels to 448×448 [32].  \\n \\nPhysically based training:  For the detection of images with \\ndifferent resolutions then this model enables the same before \\nthe network. We know the training speed is fast when the \\ngiven input is small and when the given input size is high \\nthen the speed of training is low. Physically based training can also improve its accuracy so that there will be a good balance between speed and accuracy.  \\n \\n6.

Detection of objects is a significant technique in Computer Vision for instance \\nlocation of objects in images and videos. As we compared \\nto previous classification techniques. It offers several advantages, including real -time processing, simplicity, \\nand effective handling of small objects which performs classification and object detection in one pass through the network in YOLO\\'s unified detection approach. Although \\nthere are some issues yet to be solved with some versions \\nof Yolo regarding both larger and smaller objects, it struggles with output to get perfect alignment of objects in the image. Further, these issues are surely going to be rectified and worked with the best outcome. YOLO algorithm is mainly based on a regression model, it \\npredicts all bounding boxes and classes for the entire \\nimage in one time of the algorithm, instead of selecting the region of interesting part in an Image, and Object Detection is composed of general tasks such as localization, object classification and segmentation. In the \\nperformance, the Yolo algorithm gives its best for \\ndetecting objects. We mainly reviewed unified detection, types of Yolo versions, applications based on Yolo, network architecture and comparative analysis. Overall, YOLO- based real -time object detection has \\nrevolutionized computer vision applications by providing \\nefficient and accurate solutions.  \\n \\n8. Future Scope  \\nObject detection in real -time is the main ability that is \\nwanted by most robots and computer vision systems. It’s \\nmaking great progress and giving output in many \\ndirections because of the early research in this area. It has \\nto be considered that object detection with the Yolo \\nalgorithm is not used much in many areas where it could be of great help and this could be improved in future. In fact, YOLO object detection in images has received a lot of observation in the pattern recognition sectors and \\ncomputer vision in recent years. The future of these \\nmechanisms is in the process of proving and could give freedom from routine jobs which will be done more precisely by systems and machines. Keys areas of future exploration are improved accuracy, handling complex scenes, multi -object tracking and domain- specific object \\ndetection.  \\n \\nReferences  \\n[1] Conference: Redmon, Joseph, et al. \"You only look once: \\nUnified, real -time object detection. \"Proceedings of the \\nIEEE conference on computer vision and pattern \\nrecognition. 2016.
